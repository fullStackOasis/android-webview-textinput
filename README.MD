# Demo of Android WebView Focusing on Text Input

This demo app will open a WebView of the Google home page (https://www.google.com/) in Android, focus on the text input, and open the soft keyboard so the user can immediately start typing in search terms.

Check out the gif which shows how it works. It will take a few seconds for the app to install in the Emulator. After that, you'll see the text input get focus, and the user starts typing in search keywords immediately.
